# TELOS Collaboration Resources

This repository contains resources and templates
that may be useful when preparing publications and other releases.

## Logos

The `logos/` directory contains the collaboration logo,
in SVG format,
including the standard blue version,
and a white knockout version to display against dark backgrounds.

## Author information files

The file `CITATION.cff.example` provides a template for the [`CITATION.cff`][cff] file
to include in collaboration repositories.

The file `author.xml.example` provides a template for the [`author.xml`][author-xml] file
to include in arXiv submissions.

In both cases,
all core collaboration members are included,
but the file should be edited to include any other collaborators.

In both cases,
the documentation linked above has more information on how to use these files,
as does the [collaboration reproducibility guide][repro-guide].
